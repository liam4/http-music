The beginning of an incomplete and potentially abandoned guide can be found
here: https://gist.github.com/liam4/12d2881811b9adbc01ecc50a0da495c1

It was never added to the man page because of its inconvenience; though it is
possibly a useful guide for new (and clueless) users, its length and nature of
a walkthrough instead of as examples simply made it not be fitting for a man
page.
